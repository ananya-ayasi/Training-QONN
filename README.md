# Training-QONN
Prepare 4 random 4-qubit quantum states of your choice.
Create and train a variational circuit that transforms input states into predefined output states. Namely
if random state 1 is provided, it returns state |0011>
if random state 2 is provided, it returns state |0101>
if random state 3 is provided, it returns state |1010>
if random state 4 is provided, it returns state |1100>
